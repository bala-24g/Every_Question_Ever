#Minimum spanning tree: Have a visited array, and have a minheap. Push (distance,node) pairs into the minheap. Initialise minheap with (0,0) . Result=0. While minheap, Pop minheap and if the popped node is not visited, add the weight to result, mark the popped node as visited. Then check its adjoining nodes and if they havenâ€™t been visited add (wt,nei) to the minheap. Return res.
